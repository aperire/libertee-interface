                      I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree. A
                      tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earth’s sweet
                      flowing breast; A tree that looks at God all day, And
                      lifts her leafy arms to pray; A tree that may in Summer
                      wear A nest of robins in her hair; Upon whose bosom snow
                      has lain; Who intimately lives with rain. Poems are made
                      by fools like me, But only God can make a tree.
